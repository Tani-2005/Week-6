# Week-6  
# Interactive Sales Dashboard

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The Interactive Sales Dashboard project focuses on advanced data visualization and dashboard design using Seaborn and Plotly. The goal of this project is to create professional statistical visualizations, build interactive charts, and combine multiple visualizations into a cohesive dashboard layout.

This project demonstrates advanced visualization concepts such as statistical plots, correlation heatmaps, subplot layouts, and interactive dashboards using Plotly.
